This plugin is pretty simple and easy to use. Add the appropriate settings from the config-info.yml into your ~/.siriproxy/config.yml and bundle then start SiriProxy.
To start talking to Cleverbot just say "Talk to/with Cleverbot". Response is a little slow...it does have to post everything you say to the internet and then wait for Cleverbot to respond and then retrieve Cleverbot's response...so be patient.
To stop talking to Cleverbot all you do is say "Goodbye" for your next response.
